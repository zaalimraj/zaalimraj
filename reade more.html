    <p class="p">I've started my journey in the field of computer application in 2022. I took admission into Bachelor's of Computer Applications and joined this course with a hope of achieving the best in this stream. So comes true!  </p>
    <br>
    <p class="p2">Exploration is the best way to find your inner self. I've realized that I can do more than being into computers. I started participating into different co-curricular events. Which helped to nurture me and keep me refreshing.</p>
